ByteTales - Interactive Computer Science Learning Platform
Project Assignment / Technical Documentation
================================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ByteTales is an interactive, gamified educational platform designed specifically 
for children aged 8-10 to learn Computer Science concepts. Unlike traditional 
coding tools, ByteTales uses a narrative-driven approach ("Story Lessons") where 
concepts like Input/Output, Hardware history, and Logic Gates are taught through 
animated storytelling and character-based adventures (e.g., "Robo-Ant").

Key Objectives:
- Simplify complex CS concepts using visual storytelling and videos.
- Engage students with gamification (XP, Levels, Badges, Visual Progress).
- Provide a structured learning path ("Chapters") rather than open-ended coding.
- Enable teachers to track student engagement and performance.

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: React.js (Vite) for dynamic UI and component management.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and playful "kid-friendly" design.
- Architecture: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) covering Student, Teacher, and Admin.

2. FRONTEND VISUALIZATION & COMPONENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is divided into three distinct portals based on the user role.

A. LANDING / ENTRY
   - Page: Landing Page
     - Purpose: Serves as the central gateway.
     - Features: clearly distinct entry cards for "Student", "Teacher", and "Admin" 
       to route users to their respective dashboards.

B. STUDENT PANEL (The Learning Experience)
   - Page: Student Dashboard
     - Purpose: The student's "Home Base". Displays current progress and available chapters.
     - Visuals: Simple "Chapter Grid" (e.g., "Input & Output", "History of Computer").
       Shows status (Playable/Locked) and visual icons (Monitor, History).
   
   - Page: Story Adventure (Lesson View)
     - Purpose: The core learning interface.
     - Flow: Interleaved Video -> Quiz -> Video sequence.
     - Visuals: 
       - "Video Player" for story parts (Part 1: Input, Part 2: Output).
       - "Quiz Card" for checkpoint questions with instant feedback (Green/Red highlights).
       - "Progress Bar" to track adventure completion.

   - Page: My Profile
     - Purpose: Gamification hub to motivate the student.
     - Visuals: 
       - Avatar Display (e.g., Sneha Sing).
       - XP Progress Bar & Level Indicator.
       - "Badge Collection" grid showing earned achievements (e.g., "Quiz Master").

C. TEACHER PANEL (Classroom Management)
   - Page: Teacher Dashboard
     - Purpose: Quick overview of class activity.
     - Features: Summary stats (Active Students, Course Completion).
   
   - Page: Manage Lessons
     - Purpose: Content control center.
     - Features: List view of lessons with status (Active/Draft) and edit/delete actions.

   - Page: Student Progress
     - Purpose: Detailed tracking.
     - Features: Table showing each student's name, progress %, status (Ahead/Behind), 
       and last active timestamp.

   - Page: Settings
     - Purpose: Personal account management.
     - Features: Profile editing (e.g., Teacher Santosh) and notification toggles.

D. ADMIN PANEL (Platform Administration)
   - Page: Admin Dashboard
     - Purpose: System health and high-level metrics.
     - Features: Application growth stats, total user counts.

   - Page: User Management
     - Purpose: Account administration.
     - Features: Tabbed table to filter Students vs. Teachers, with "Add User" modal.

   - Page: Content Management
     - Purpose: Curriculum oversight.
     - Features: High-level view of all courses and enrollment numbers across the platform.
